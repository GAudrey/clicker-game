Make a clicker game with the basic click to earn point and assets to earn points when not clicking.

## Objectives

* Discover React
* Make a clicker game
* Use of file.jsx

## What did I use?

* React
* Parcel
* Tailwind (css not done yet)

## What can be improved?

The code itself. I think it lacks and that I didn't use correctly the file.jsx system. And obviously, it's not pretty yet, it just works.

I must add copyright in the website too.

It's not launch yet either.

## Thanks
